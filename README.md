## Horror camp
### It was a sunny day in Cleveland when Suzanne and her two besties, Caroline and Pablo took the bus to the Fantasy Camp. They have been waiting for this moment all the year and finally, the summer arrived. At first, their parents were not sure about the idea of sending their fifteen-year old children to a camp located in the mountain known as the "death hill". In fact, those stories were only urban legends... weren't they?
Suzanne, Caroline and Pablo loved **horror stories**. Since their very childhood, they used to enjoy playing ghosts and monsters. Why would a so called _Death Hill_ were supposed to scare them? One day, while the two girls were playing cards, they heard Pablo screaming. **AHHHHHHH**, _He shouted_ **Girls! Come in the kitchen, something happened!**
Surprised, they stopped their game and decided to go see what was going on...
