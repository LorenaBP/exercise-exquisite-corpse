## Horror camp
### It was a sunny day in Cleveland when Suzanne and her two besties, Caroline and Pablo took the bus to the Fantasy Camp. They have been waiting for this moment all the year and finally, the summer arrived. At first, their parents were not sure about the idea of sending their fifteen-year old children to a camp located in the mountain known as the "death hill". In fact, those stories were only urban legends... weren't they?
Caroline was convinced that ghosts and paranormal stuff didn't exist and that it was always a coincidence of some sort.
Pablo on the other hand, firmly believed that there _ARE_ some things that science can't explain and that there are caused by beings out of this world. And to prove his point, he was ready to sacrifice a lot. But not burgers. Because burgers are **life**.
When the bus finally arrived, Caroline and Pablo immediately had an uneasy feeling. Something was wrong. And they were right.
